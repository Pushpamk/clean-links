Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Product Name: Clean Links
Document Version: 1.0
Author: Pushpam

Date: September 2, 2025

1. Introduction & Overview
The "Clean Links" browser extension is a lightweight, single-purpose tool designed to improve user privacy and link sharing hygiene. Its core function is to automatically "clean" a URL by removing all query parameters (the portion of a URL after the ? character) whenever the user copies a link from their browser. This ensures that the copied URL is a simple, root-level address, free from tracking data and unnecessary clutter.

2. Problem Statement
Many websites, especially e-commerce, news, and social media platforms, append a large number of query parameters to URLs. These parameters are often used for tracking user behavior, attributing clicks, and personalizing content. While functional, they create long, messy links that can compromise user privacy when shared and clutter text messages, emails, and documents. Users lack a seamless way to copy a simplified, clean version of a URL without manually editing it.

3. Goals & Objectives
Primary Goal: Provide a frictionless way for users to copy clean URLs.

Objective 1: Automatically detect when a user copies a link.

Objective 2: Strip all query parameters from the copied URL.

Objective 3: Replace the content in the user's clipboard with the cleaned URL.

Objective 4: Provide a non-intrusive, real-time feedback mechanism to the user.

4. Target Audience
The target audience is any internet user who values simplicity, privacy, and clean data. This includes but is not limited to:

Privacy-conscious individuals: Users who do not want to share tracking data.

Knowledge workers & researchers: People who share links in documents, reports, and emails.

Everyday users: Anyone who copies and pastes links frequently and is annoyed by their length.

5. User Stories
As a user, I want the extension to automatically clean any URL I copy, so I don't have to manually edit it.

As a user, I want a small notification or visual cue to appear when a link has been cleaned, so I know the extension is working.

As a user, I want the extension to be simple and require no configuration, so I can use it immediately.

6. Functional Requirements
6.1. Core Functionality
Event Detection: The extension must listen for a specific event that indicates a user has copied text. This will likely be the copy event on the window object.

URL Parsing: Upon detecting the copy event, the extension must check if the copied text is a valid URL.

Parameter Stripping: The URL must be processed to remove the query string and all its parameters.

The query string is the portion of the URL starting with and including the first ?.

Example: https://www.example.com/product?ref=social&source=banner should be cleaned to https://www.example.com/product.

Clipboard Manipulation: The extension must programmatically overwrite the content of the user's clipboard with the newly cleaned URL. This must be a silent process for the user.

6.2. User Interface & Feedback
No Persistent UI: The extension will have no persistent popup or sidebar. It will operate silently in the background.

Ephemeral Notification: A small, unobtrusive visual cue (e.g., a simple, temporary toast notification or a small icon change) will appear briefly in the browser to confirm that a URL has been cleaned. This should last for a maximum of 2-3 seconds. The notification message could be "Link cleaned!" or similar.

7. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance: The processing of the URL must be instantaneous, with no perceptible delay to the user. The extension should be lightweight and consume minimal CPU and memory.

Security: The extension must follow all security best practices for browser extensions. It should only request the minimum required permissions to perform its function (e.g., clipboardRead and clipboardWrite). No user data should be stored or transmitted.

Privacy: The extension's core function is to enhance privacy. It must not collect, store, or transmit any user data, URLs, or clipboard content.

Compatibility: The extension should be compatible with major browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

8. Future Considerations (Out of Scope for v1)
URL Whitelisting/Blacklisting: Allow users to specify certain domains where the extension should or should not operate.

Advanced Parameter Stripping: Implement more intelligent cleaning that can selectively remove specific tracking parameters while preserving necessary ones (e.g., in a complex web app).

UI for Manual Cleaning: Add a context menu option to "Clean and Copy" for users who prefer manual control.

URL Shortening Integration: Offer an option to shorten the cleaned URL using a service like bit.ly.
